Lumberjack is an extension to the Ruby standard library `Logger` class, designed to provide advanced, flexible, and structured logging for Ruby applications. It builds on the familiar `Logger` API, adding powerful features for modern logging needs:

- **Attributes for Structured Logging:** Use attributes (formerly called tags) to attach structured, machine-readable metadata to log entries, enabling better filtering, searching, and analytics.
- **Context Isolation:** Isolate specific logging behavior to isolated blocks of code. The attributes, level, and progname for the logger can all be changed in a context block and only impact the log messages created within that block.
- **Formatters:** Control how objects are logged with customizable formatters for messages and attributes.
- **Devices and Templates:** Choose from a variety of output devices and templates to define the format and destination of your logs, including compatibility with standard library log devices and support for custom output formats.
- **Testing Tools:** Built-in testing devices and helpers make it easy to assert logging behavior in your test suite.

Lumberjack is ideal for applications that require structured, context-aware logging, and integrates seamlessly with Rubyâ€™s standard logging ecosystem.
