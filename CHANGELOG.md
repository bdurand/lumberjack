# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.3.1

### Added

- Added `Lumberjack::Logger#context` method to set up a context block for the logger. This is the same as calling `Lumberjack::Logger#tag` with an empty hash.
- Log entries now remove empty tag values so they don't have to be removed downstream.

### Fixed

- ActiveSupport::TaggedLogger now calls `Lumberjack::Logger#tag_globally` to prevent deprecation warnings.

## 1.3.0

### Added

- Added `Lumberjack::Formatter::TaggedMessage` to allow extracting tags from log messages via a formatter in order to better support structured logging of objects.
- Added built in `:round` formatter to round numbers to a specified number of decimal places.
- Added built in `:redact` formatter to redact sensitive information from log tags.
- Added support in `Lumberjack::TagFormatter` for class formatters. Class formatters will be applied to any tag values that match the class.
- Apply formatters to enumerable values in tags. Name formatters are applied using dot syntax when a tag value contains a hash.
- Added support for a dedicated message formatter that can override the default formatter on the log message.
- Added support for setting tags from the request environment in `Lumberjack::Rack::Context` middleware.
- Added helper methods to generate global PID's and thread ids.
- Added `Lumberjack::Logger#tag_globally` to explicitly set a global tag for all loggers.
- Added `Lumberjack::Logger#tag_value` to get the value of a tag by name from the current tag context.
- Added `Lumberjack::Utils.hostname` to get the hostname in UTF-8 encoding.
- Added `Lumberjack::Utils.global_pid` to get a global process id in a consistent format.
- Added `Lumberjack::Utils.global_thread_id` to get a thread id in a consistent format.
- Added `Lumberjack::Utils.thread_name` to get a thread name in a consistent format.
- Added support for `ActiveSupport::Logging.logger_outputs_to?` to check if a logger is outputting to a specific IO stream.
- Added `Lumberjack::Logger#log_at` method to temporarily set the log level for a block of code for compatibility with ActiveSupport loggers.

### Changed

- Default date/time format for log entries is now ISO-8601 with microsecond precision.
- Tags that are set to hash values will now be flattened into dot-separated keys in templates.

### Removed

- Removed support for Ruby versions < 2.5.

### Deprecated

- All unit of work related functionality from version 1.0 has been officially deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0. Use tags instead to set a global context for log entries.
- Calling `Lumberjack::Logger#tag` without a block is deprecated. Use `Lumberjack::Logger#tag_globally` instead.

## 1.2.10

### Added

- Added `with_level` method for compatibility with the latest standard library logger gem.

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in magic frozen string literal comments. (thanks @andyw8 and @steveclarke)

## 1.2.9

### Added

- Allow passing in formatters as class names when adding them.
- Allow passing in formatters initialization arguments when adding them.
- Add truncate formatter for capping the length of log messages.

## 1.2.8

### Added

- Add `Logger#untagged` to remove previously set logging tags from a block.
- Return result of the block when a block is passed to `Logger#tag`.

## 1.2.7

### Fixed

- Allow passing frozen hashes to `Logger#tag`. Tags passed to this method are now duplicated so the logger maintains it's own copy of the hash.

## 1.2.6

### Added

- Add Logger#remove_tag

### Fixed

- Fix `Logger#tag` so it only ads to the current block's logger tags instead of the global tags if called inside a `Logger#tag` block.


## 1.2.5

### Added

- Add support for bang methods (error!) for setting the log level.

### Fixed

- Fixed logic with recursive reference guard in StructuredFormatter so it only suppresses Enumerable references.

## 1.2.4

### Added

- Enhance `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging` support so code that Lumberjack loggers can be wrapped with a tagged logger.

## 1.2.3

### Fixed

- Fix structured formatter so no-recursive, duplicate references are allowed.

## 1.2.2

### Fixed

- Prevent infinite loops in the structured formatter where objects have backreferences to each other.

## 1.2.1

### Fixed

- Prevent infinite loops where logging a statement triggers the logger.

## 1.2.0

### Added

- Enable compatibility with `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogger` by calling `tagged_logger!` on a logger.
- Add `tag_formatter` to logger to specify formatting of tags for output.
- Allow adding and removing classes by name to formatters.
- Allow adding and removing multiple classes in a single call to a formatter.
- Allow using symbols and strings as log level for silencing a logger.
- Ensure flusher thread gets stopped when logger is closed.
- Add writer for logger device attribute.
- Handle passing an array of devices to a multi device.
- Helper method to get a tag with a specified name.
- Add strip formatter to strip whitespace from strings.
- Support non-alpha numeric characters in template variables.
- Add backtrace cleaner to ExceptionFormatter.

## 1.1.1

### Added

- Replace Procs in tag values with the value of calling the Proc in log entries.

## 1.1.0

### Added

- Change `Lumberjack::Logger` to inherit from ::Logger
- Add support for tags on log messages
- Add global tag context for all loggers
- Add per logger tags and tag contexts
- Reimplement unit of work id as a tag on log entries
- Add support for setting datetime format on log devices
- Performance optimizations
- Add Multi device to output to multiple devices
- Add `DateTimeFormatter`, `IdFormatter`, `ObjectFormatter`, and `StructuredFormatter`
- Add rack `Context` middleware for setting thread global context
- Add support for modules in formatters

### Removed

- End support for ruby versions < 2.3

## 1.0.13

### Added

- Added `:min_roll_check` option to `Lumberjack::Device::RollingLogFile` to reduce file system checks. Default is now to only check if a file needs to be rolled at most once per second.
- Force immutable strings for Ruby versions that support them.

### Changed

- Reduce amount of code executed inside a mutex lock when writing to the logger stream.

## 1.0.12

- Fix gemspec files to be flat array (thanks @e2).

## 1.0.10

### Added

- Expose option to manually roll log files.

### Changed

- Minor code cleanup.

## 1.0.9
