## 1.2.10

### Added

- Added `with_level` method for compatibility with the latest standard library logger gem.

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in magic frozen string literal comments. (thanks @andyw8 and @steveclarke)

## 1.2.9

### Added

- Allow passing in formatters as class names when adding them.
- Allow passing in formatters initialization arguments when adding them.
- Add truncate formatter for capping the length of log messages.

## 1.2.8

- Add `Logger#untagged` to remove previously set logging tags from a block.
- Return result of the block when a block is passed to `Logger#tag`.

## 1.2.7

### Fixed

## 1.2.6

### Added

### Fixed

- Fix `Logger#tag` so it only ads to the current block's logger tags instead of the global tags if called inside a `Logger#tag` block.


## 1.2.5

### Added

- Add support for bang methods (error!) for setting the log level.

### Fixed

- Fixed logic with recursive reference guard in StructuredFormatter so it only suppresses Enumerable references.

## 1.2.4
